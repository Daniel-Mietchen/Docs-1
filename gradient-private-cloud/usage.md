# Usage

## Finding your Cluster

Your clusters are available under the _Private Clusters_ [page](https://www.paperspace.com/console/clusters) in the Paperspace console.  Here you can find information about your cluster, including your cluster ID â€“ you will need to specify this ID in order to designate your private cluster as the place to run experiments, notebooks, etc.

## **Using Gradient Private Cloud via the Gradient CLI**

```bash
gradient <command> ... --clusterId <your cluster ID>
```

`--clusterId string` Cluster ID for this processing site, e.g. "clxxxxxxx". 

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need to provide your API key to authenticate your requests. Learn how to obtain and set your API key [here](../get-started/install-the-cli.md#obtaining-an-api-key).
{% endhint %}

A complete example of utilizing Gradient features on a Gradient Private Cloud cluster might look like this:

```bash
gradient experiments run singlenode --name experiment1 \
--projectId prgydf45k \
--clusterId cl53waq2x \
--machineType c5.xlarge \
--container tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-py3 \
--experimentEnv "{\"EPOCHS_EVAL\":\"5\",\"TRAIN_EPOCHS\":\"10\",\"MAX_STEPS\":\"1000\",\"EVAL_SECS\":\"10\"}" \
--workspaceUrl https://github.com/Paperspace/mnist-sample.git \
--command "pip install -r requirements.txt && python mnist.py" \
--vpc
```

In addition to the Cluster ID, the --vpc flag is required for Gradient Private Cloud processing sites. In order to allocate workloads to your private cluster, the clusterID parameter and --vpc flag must be set on most Gradient primary commands, including:

* experiments
* deployments
* jobs
* models
* notebooks
* tensorboards

To avoid having to re-enter the Cluster ID, and if you want the configuration to be reusable and checked into source control, another option is using the [Gradient Config File](../experiments/using-experiments/gradient-config.yaml.md). This file can contain the clusterID parameter in addition to many other common settings.

## **Using Gradient Private Cloud via the web console**

When creating a notebook, an experiment, or a model deployment, select your private cluster in the console, then select an instance type that's available in your cluster.
