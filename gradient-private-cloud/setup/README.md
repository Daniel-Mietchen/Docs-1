# Setup

Gradient clusters can be installed on any cloud provider or your own infrastructure. There are multiple ways to set up a Gradient cluster depending on your environment and your machine learning needs.

* [Managed Install](managed-installation.md) - Create a Gradient cluster as a fully managed service on Paperspace Cloud
* [Gradient Installer CLI](gradient-installer-cli.md) - Create a Gradient cluster on AWS, GCP, Azure, or private servers via the CLI
* [Terraform](terraform/) - Install Gradient directly into existing Terraforrm infrastructure
