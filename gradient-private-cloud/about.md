# Overview

Gradient clusters are private clusters that run machine learning workloads. Gradient clusters can be created on Paperspace Cloud as a [managed service](setup/managed-installation.md), directly on Paperspace Core VMs, on any other cloud provider \(AWS, GCP, Azure\), or on your own servers via the [Gradient Installer](setup/self-hosted-clusters/).

Find out more about Gradient's multi-cloud capabilities [here](https://gradient.paperspace.com/clusters).

You can [create a managed Gradient Cluster on Paperspace using the Web UI](https://console.paperspace.com/clusters/create) in a couple of clicks.
