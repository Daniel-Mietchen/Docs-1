# About

Paperspace Machines are the basic building blocks of Paperspace Core and can be taken advantage of using the GUI or via the CLI.

You can build a Windows or Linux virtual machine quickly, choose a GPU or CPU machine and any additional add-ons.

To list your existing machines or create a new one via the GUI, navigate to Core &gt; Compute &gt; Machines in the Side Nav.

Alternately, you can [List your Machines via the CLI](list-machines.md).
