## Create a GradientCI Project

GradientCI Projects allow you to connect a GitHub repository to your Project in order to automatically run experiments when you push new commits or open PRs.

Visit [www.paperspace.com/console/projects](https://www.paperspace.com/console/projects), click _Create Project_, and select **Create GradientCI Project**. Make sure you have installed **GradientCI** on the target repository to which you'll link your Project.
