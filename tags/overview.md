Tags are a powerful feature in Gradient that allow teams to organize and track machine learning work.

A tag is simply an alphanumeric word or phrase scoped to a team that team members can apply to any taggable entity and then use to filter entity list results. Taggable entity types include Projects, Experiments, Notebooks, Jobs, Models, and Deployments.

![Projects list filtered on &apos;PyTorch&apos; tag shows 8 projects with that tag](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-02-10-at-7.25.47-pm.png)

Team admins and entity creators can add tags to entities, and all team members can filter any entity on any tag. Any time a team member adds a tag that doesn't already exist within their team, it becomes available to be used across all entities.
