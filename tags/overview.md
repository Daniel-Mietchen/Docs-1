# Overview

Tagging is a powerful feature in Gradient that allows teams to organize and track machine learning work.

A tag is an alphanumeric word or phrase scoped to a team that team members can apply to any taggable entity. Entities may then be filtered by tag for easy access and oversight. Taggable entity types include Projects, Experiments, Notebooks, Jobs, Models, and Deployments.

Team admins and entity creators may add tags to entities. All team members may filter any entity on any tag. Any time a team member adds a tag that doesn't already exist within their team, the tag becomes available across all entities.
