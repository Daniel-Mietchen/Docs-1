# Using Tags

## Adding, Creating, Removing, and Filtering on Tags

### Adding Tags to Entities

Team admins can add new and existing tags to any of their team's entities, and team members can add new and existing tags to entities that they created. Any new tag that is added, will become available for use across all of a team's entities.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web UI" %}
To add, create, or remove tags on any taggable entity, click the **Tag** button. This will open the **Edit Tags** modal, where you can: 1\) see any current tags on that entity; 2\) create and add new tags; and 3\) remove current tags. After you've added or removed tags, click **Submit** to finalize your changes.

### Filtering Entities on Tags

{% tabs %}

To find entities with a specific tag, first click the **Filter by tags** dropdown at the top of any entity list, such as Projects below.

Then, type or select tags to filter that entity on. This will result in all entities, such as Projects below, that match any selected tag.
