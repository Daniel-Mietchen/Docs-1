# About

Gradient Models can be created in two ways: they can be 1\) generated by running machine learning Experiments, or 2\) imported into Gradient by uploading them directly from the GUI or CLI.

Gradient has a repository of Models per team, as well as a Public Models repository. If you want a Generated Model to appear in your team's Model Repository, be sure to [use the appropriate **Model Path**](model-path.md#default-paths). Uploaded Models will automatically be placed in your team's Model Repository.

The Model Repository holds references to all uploaded Models and any Experiment-generated Models that were generated with the appropriate Model Path; this includes model and checkpoint files generated during an Experiment's training period, as well as summary metrics associated with the model's performance, such as accuracy and loss.

**Currently Supported Models:**

* [TensorFlow 1.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)

**Future Supported Models:**

* ONNX \(Open Neural Network Exchange\) 
* Custom
