# Overview

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2856%29.png)

The Gradient model repository is a hub for importing, managing, and deploying ML models.  Gradient offers the ability to create your own **custom models** and in addition to launching pre-trained **public models**.  

Gradient Models can be created in two ways: they can be 1\) generated by running machine learning Experiments, or 2\) imported into Gradient by uploading them directly from the GUI or CLI.  Learn more [here](create-a-model.md).

Gradient has a repository of Models per team, as well as a Public Models repository. If you want a Generated Model to appear in your team's Model Repository, be sure to [use the appropriate **Model Path**](model-path.md#default-paths). Uploaded Models will automatically be placed in your team's Model Repository.

The Model Repository holds references to all uploaded Models and any Experiment-generated Models. This includes model and checkpoint files generated during an Experiment's training period as well as summary metrics associated with the model's performance, such as accuracy and loss.

**Supported Models:**

* [TensorFlow 1.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)
* ONNX \(Open Neural Network Exchange\) 
* Custom
