# Default Model path

For an experiment to output a model in the Gradient system the resulting model files need to be written to the specified or default model path.

## PS\_MODEL\_PATH

Using the PS\_MODEL\_PATH environment variable is the easiest way to make sure you are outputting to the correct location.

```python
model_dir = os.path.abspath(os.environ.get('PS_MODEL_PATH'))
#ï¿½You can also use gradient_sdk:
from gradient_sdk.utils import model_dir
```

## Default paths

**Singlenode**: `--modelPath /artifacts` is currently the default for singlenode experiments. Output your model files there to appear in your Model Repository so that you can deploy it using Deployments

**Multinode:** The default model path for multinode experiments is `/storage/models/<experiment_id>/`

{% hint style="info" %}
When in an on-premise or VPC environment, the default model path will be `/shared/models/<experiment_id>`
{% endhint %}

## Custom model metadata

When `modelType` is not specified, custom model metadata can be associated with the model for later reference by creating a **gradient-model-metadata.json** file in the `modelPath` directory. Any valid JSON data can be stored in this file.

For models of type `Tensorflow`, metadata is automatically generated for your experiment, so any custom model metadata will be ignored.

An example of custom model metadata JSON is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "accuracy-score",  
      "numberValue": 60
    }
  ]
}
```
