# Using Notebooks

## Create a Notebook

### Choose your Base Container

Notebooks can be created by clicking _Create Notebook_ button on the Notebooks tab.  There are three types of base containers:

#### Popular Containers \(Basic\)

These are the templates that are most popular on Gradient.  They include the most common ML frameworks and libraries.  [Click here](../notebook-containers/) to discover which Notebook Base Container will best suit your use case, then choose it from the options below:

### Choose the instance type

This is [instance type](../../instances/instance-types.md) that your notebook will run on. Our hardware is configured to work with the tools and packages in each of the provided containers.

### Optional Settings:

#### Name your Notebook

Provide a friendly name for your Notebook in the text field

#### Auto-shutdown

If you have a [Gradient subscription](https://gradient.paperspace.com/pricing), you will have the ability to set a custom auto-shutdown interval. 

If you do not have a Gradient subscription, your notebook will default to an auto-shutdown interval of 12 hours, to help avoid unexpected runtime charges. Once created, you can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. 

### Click Create

That's it! Your Notebook will start once it has been created ðŸš€

Once created, your Notebook will automatically start.  Just click _Open_ and your Notebook will appear in a new browser tab.

When you click _Start_, a window will appear that presents a few options such as the name, the instance type, and the Auto-Shutdown interval.

## Stop a Notebook

Click the _Stop_ button to stop your Notebook from running. When your Notebook is stopped, the billing session will end. You'll see how long your Running Time was for the latest session.

## Delete a Notebook

Click Delete to remove your Notebook. Careful - this will permanently delete your Notebook!

You can only delete a notebook once it has stopped running.
