### Popular Containers \(Basic\)

## Optional Settings:

### Name your Notebook

Provide a friendly name for your Notebook in the text field

### Auto-shutdown

If you have a [Gradient subscription](https://gradient.paperspace.com/pricing), you will have the ability to set a custom auto-shutdown interval. 

If you do not have a Gradient subscription, your notebook will default to an auto-shutdown interval of 12 hours, to help avoid unexpected runtime charges. Once created, you can stop, start, fork, and swap out the instance type anytime. 

## Click Create

That's it! Your Notebook will start once it has been created ðŸš€

Once created, your Notebook will automatically start.  Just click _Open_ and your Notebook will appear in a new browser tab.
