# About

TensorBoards enable you to visualize and compare your machine learning experiments.

TensorBoards are currently a Gradient Enterprise-only feature. [Contact Sales](https://gradient.paperspace.com/enterprise) for inquiries!

Note that TensorBoards run on CPU machine instances â€“ they are not just database resources. This means that creating TensorBoards and adding experiments to them, can sometimes take a couple of minutes.

When you Add an experiment to a TensorBoard, the experiment status will remain in an Adding state until the experiment has completed.

Adding or Deleting an experiment to/from a TensorBoard can take a couple of minutes.
